## 1. Overview

This proposal describes how the **Agent Gateway** (control plane) and **agent daemons** (worker LPARs) establish mutual TLS (mTLS) for all gRPC communication.

There are two distinct phases:

- **Bootstrap (first contact):** A new agent daemon has no certificate yet. It connects to the gateway using a single-use pre-shared token, submits a CSR, and receives both a CA-signed client certificate and the server's `ca.crt` in return. This first connection uses TLS (server-only) with an optional CA verification fallback.
- **Operational (post-bootstrap):** All subsequent connections — including the long-lived `CommandStream` — use strict mTLS. The gateway requires and verifies the agent's client certificate. The agent verifies the gateway's server certificate against `ca.crt`.

---

## 2. Goals

| Goal | Approach |
|---|---|
| Encrypted agent-to-gateway communication | TLS on all gRPC connections; mTLS after bootstrap |
| Authenticated agents only on `CommandStream` | Client certificate required and verified against CA pool |
| Zero pre-distributed secrets except token | Agent generates its own key locally; only a short-lived pre-shared token is distributed |
| Credential freshness on every restart | `hasValidTLSCredentials` checks expiry and probes the gateway live before skipping re-registration |
| Cert lifecycle tied to agent onboarding | Bootstrap generates ECDSA key + CSR; gateway signs and delivers the cert |
| Fail-safe token guard | Registration is rejected immediately if no valid cert exists and no token is provided |

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Component Roles

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph CP["Control Plane (VM-CP)"]
    GW["AgentGateway\n:9090 gRPC"]
    CA["Internal CA\n(caCert + caKey)"]
    TS["TokenStore\n(pre-shared tokens)"]
    REG["Registry\n(agent state)"]
    GW --> CA
    GW --> TS
    GW --> REG
  end

  subgraph W1["Worker LPAR 1"]
    AD1["Agent Daemon"]
    TLS1["/etc/ai-services/agent-tls/\ntls.crt · tls.key · ca.crt"]
    AD1 --> TLS1
  end

  subgraph W2["Worker LPAR 2"]
    AD2["Agent Daemon"]
    TLS2["/etc/ai-services/agent-tls/\ntls.crt · tls.key · ca.crt"]
    AD2 --> TLS2
  end

  W1 -- "gRPC mTLS (:9090)" --> CP
  W2 -- "gRPC mTLS (:9090)" --> CP
```

### 3.2 Ports and Listeners

| Port | Purpose | TLS Mode |
|------|---------|----------|
| `:9090` | Agent Gateway gRPC — `Register` + `CommandStream` | Hybrid: TLS-only for `Register` (bootstrap), strict mTLS for `CommandStream` |

### 3.3 gRPC Service Definition

```protobuf
service AgentGateway {
  // Called once at bootstrap — TLS only (no client cert required).
  rpc Register(RegisterRequest) returns (RegisterResponse);

  // Long-lived bidirectional stream — strict mTLS required.
  rpc CommandStream(stream CommandResult) returns (stream Command);
}
```

## 4. Certificate Authority and PKI

The PKI is rooted in a single internal CA created once on the control plane during `catalog configure`. All files are persisted under `/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/` and loaded into the `Gateway` at startup.

### 4.1 Root CA

Generated once during `catalog configure --agentgateway-port` and persisted on the control plane. The public `ca.crt` is returned to every worker LPAR in `RegisterResponse` so agents can verify the gateway's server certificate on all future connections.

```
/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/ca.key   — CA private key  (0600, control plane only)
/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/ca.crt   — CA public cert  (0644, returned to agents via RegisterResponse)
```

### 4.2 Gateway Server Certificate

Generated during `catalog configure` immediately after the root CA is available. Signed by the root CA and persisted alongside it. The gateway loads it at startup and presents it to every connecting agent.

```
/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/server.key  — server private key (0600)
/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/server.crt  — server public cert (0644, serverAuth EKU)
```

### 4.3 Agent Client Certificate

Each agent receives a unique ECDSA P-256 certificate signed by the root CA. The certificate encodes the agent's identity:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `Subject.CommonName` | `conf.AgentName` (e.g. `worker-lpar-01`) |
| `Subject.Organization` | `system:agents` |
| `ExtKeyUsage` | `clientAuth` |
| `KeyUsage` | `DigitalSignature`, `KeyEncipherment` |
| Lifetime | 1 year (`NotAfter = now + 365d`) |
| Key algorithm | ECDSA P-256 — generated locally by the agent |

> The private key is generated on the worker LPAR and **never transmitted**. Only the CSR (public key + identity) is sent to the gateway.

### 4.4 Control Plane PKI Bootstrap

The PKI is initialised as part of `ai-services catalog configure --agentgateway-port <port>`. The process supports two modes:

**Mode A — Operator-provided CA (recommended for production):**
The operator supplies an existing CA key and certificate via flags. The gateway uses these to sign agent certificates. This allows integration with an existing PKI.

```
ai-services catalog configure --runtime podman \
  --agentgateway-port 9090 \
  --gateway-ca-cert /path/to/ca.crt \
  --gateway-ca-key  /path/to/ca.key
```

The provided material is validated before any files are written. All four checks must pass or `catalog configure` exits with an error:

| # | Check | How |
|---|---|---|
| ① | Cert and key correspond to each other | `tls.X509KeyPair(certPEM, keyPEM)` — errors if the private key doesn't match the public key in the cert |
| ② | Certificate is a CA | `cert.IsCA == true && cert.BasicConstraintsValid == true` |
| ③ | Certificate is currently valid | `time.Now()` is between `cert.NotBefore` and `cert.NotAfter` |
| ④ | Certificate can sign other certs | `cert.KeyUsage & x509.KeyUsageCertSign != 0` |

**Mode B — Auto-generated CA (default for fresh deployments):**
If no CA is provided, `catalog configure` generates a new ECDSA P-256 root CA and server certificate automatically. This is the zero-touch path for new installations.

The full PKI generation flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([catalog configure\n--agentgateway-port 9090]) --> B{--gateway-ca-cert\n+ --gateway-ca-key\nprovided?}
  B -- "yes — operator-provided CA" --> C["Validate provided CA cert + key pair\n① cert and key match (tls.X509KeyPair)\n② cert.IsCA == true && BasicConstraintsValid\n③ time.Now between NotBefore and NotAfter\n④ KeyUsage includes KeyUsageCertSign"]
  C -- "validation fails" --> CERR([Error: invalid CA material\ncatalog configure exits])
  C -- "validation passes" --> D[Copy ca.key + ca.crt\nto /var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/]
  B -- "no — auto-generate" --> E[Generate ECDSA P-256\nroot CA key]
  E --> F[Self-sign root CA cert\nCN=ai-services-agent-ca\nTTL=10 years]
  F --> D
  D --> G[Generate ECDSA P-256\nserver key]
  G --> H["Sign server cert with CA\nCN=AgentGateway\nSAN=ControlPlaneURL\nEKU=serverAuth\nTTL=1 year"]
  H --> I["Persist to /var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/\nca.key   (0600)\nca.crt   (0644)\nserver.key (0600)\nserver.crt (0644)"]
  I --> J[Load into Gateway struct\ncaCert · caKey · serverCert · caCertPool]
  J --> K([AgentGateway starts\nlistening on :9090])
```

**Persisted files on the control plane:**

| File | Contents | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/ca.key` | Root CA private key | `0600` |
| `/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/ca.crt` | Root CA public certificate | `0644` |
| `/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/server.key` | Gateway server private key | `0600` |
| `/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/server.crt` | Gateway server certificate (`serverAuth`) | `0644` |

On subsequent restarts, if all four files are already present in `/var/lib/ai-services/gateway-pki/`, the PKI generation step is skipped and the existing material is loaded directly.

## 5. Agent Bootstrap — Certificate Provisioning

### 5.1 Bootstrap Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Agent daemon starts]) --> B{hasValidTLSCredentials?}
  B -- "yes — cert not expired\n+ live mTLS probe succeeds" --> Z([Skip registration\nuse existing credentials])
  B -- "no" --> C{PreSharedToken\nprovided?}
  C -- "no" --> ERR([Error: cannot register\nwithout token])
  C -- "yes" --> D[Generate ECDSA P-256\nprivate key locally]
  D --> E["Build CSR\nCN=AgentName · Org=system:agents\nAlgo=ECDSAWithSHA256"]
  E --> F["Resolve TLS config via buildTLSConfig\nca.crt present → RootCAs pool\nca.crt absent  → InsecureSkipVerify"]
  F --> G[Dial AgentGateway :9090\nTLS only — no client cert]
  G --> H["Call Register RPC\n(AgentName · PreSharedToken · CSR · Labels · Capabilities)"]
  H --> I{Token valid?\nCSR CN == AgentName?\nCSR signature OK?}
  I -- "no" --> REJECT([Registration rejected])
  I -- "yes" --> J["Gateway signs CSR with rootCA\nSerial = rand 128-bit\nNotAfter = now + 1 year"]
  J --> K["Write tls.crt → 0644\nWrite tls.key → 0600\nWrite ca.crt  → 0644\nto /etc/ai-services/agent-tls/"]
  K --> L[Agent marked READY\nin Registry]
  L --> M([Open CommandStream\nusing mTLS])
```

### 5.2 Credential Validation on Restart

When the agent daemon restarts, `hasValidTLSCredentials` runs **before** any registration attempt. It performs three checks in order and returns `false` at the first failure, triggering fresh registration:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Agent restarts]) --> B["Load tls.crt + tls.key\nfrom /etc/ai-services/agent-tls/"]
  B --> C{Key pair loads OK?}
  C -- "no — files missing\nor mismatched" --> FAIL([false → proceed to Register])
  C -- "yes" --> D{Certificate not expired?\ntime.Now before NotAfter}
  D -- "expired" --> FAIL
  D -- "valid" --> E["Dial AgentGateway :9090\nwith tls.crt as client cert\n+ ca.crt for server verify\n(via buildTLSConfig)"]
  E --> F["Probe: Register RPC\n(AgentName only — no token)"]
  F --> G{gRPC status code?}
  G -- "Unauthenticated\nor Unavailable" --> FAIL
  G -- "any other code\ne.g. InvalidArgument" --> OK([true → skip re-registration])
```

> Any non-`Unauthenticated` / non-`Unavailable` response means the mTLS handshake succeeded — the gateway accepted the client certificate. Application-layer errors (e.g. `InvalidArgument` for a missing token on the probe) are expected and treated as a passing credential check.

---

## 6. TLS Configuration Details

### 6.1 Gateway Server (Control Plane)

Configured in `Gateway.Start()`. The server uses `VerifyClientCertIfGiven` at the TLS layer to allow unauthenticated `Register` calls during bootstrap; mTLS is then enforced at the application layer by interceptors:

```go
tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
    Certificates: []tls.Certificate{g.serverCert}, // gateway's own cert
    ClientCAs:    g.caCertPool,                     // CA pool to verify agent certs
    ClientAuth:   tls.VerifyClientCertIfGiven,      // optional at TLS layer...
}
// ...enforced at the application layer by authStreamInterceptor
```

| RPC | TLS layer | Interceptor enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| `Register` | TLS (no client cert required) | Bypassed — pre-shared token auth instead |
| `CommandStream` | mTLS (client cert verified if present) | `authStreamInterceptor` requires a verified chain |

Agent identity is extracted from the certificate after the TLS handshake:

```go
// extractAndVerifyAgentIdentity
clientCert := tlsInfo.State.VerifiedChains[0][0]
agentID := clientCert.Subject.CommonName
```

### 6.2 Agent Client (Worker Daemon)

`buildTLSConfig(tlsDir, clientCert)` centralises all TLS config construction:

```go
// Bootstrap (no client cert yet):
buildTLSConfig(tlsDir, nil)
// → cfg.Certificates = []        (no client cert presented)
// → cfg.RootCAs = pool(ca.crt)   (or InsecureSkipVerify if ca.crt absent)

// Post-bootstrap credential check and CommandStream:
buildTLSConfig(tlsDir, &cert)
// → cfg.Certificates = []tls.Certificate{cert}  (agent presents tls.crt)
// → cfg.RootCAs = pool(ca.crt)                  (strict server verification)
```

Files written to `tlsDir` (`/etc/ai-services/agent-tls/`) by `writeTLSMaterial`:

| File | Contents | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `tls.crt` | CA-signed agent public certificate | `0644` |
| `tls.key` | Agent ECDSA private key | `0600` |
| `ca.crt` | Root CA public certificate (returned by gateway in `RegisterResponse`) | `0644` |

## 7. Hybrid TLS — Bootstrap vs mTLS Mode

## 8. Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Private key generated on the worker | The gateway never sees the private key; only the CSR (public material) is transmitted |
| ECDSA P-256 for agent keys | Smaller key sizes, faster handshakes vs RSA; adequate for 1-year cert lifetime |
| `VerifyClientCertIfGiven` at TLS layer | Allows unauthenticated `Register` without a separate port or listener |
| Application-layer interceptors enforce mTLS | Interceptors gate `CommandStream` independently of the TLS layer setting, providing defence-in-depth |
| `hasValidTLSCredentials` probes gateway live | Catches revoked certs, CA rotation, and connectivity loss before skipping re-registration |
| Token guard before key generation | Fail-fast if there's no valid cert and no token — avoids generating an unusable key pair |
| Single CA signs both server and agent certs | Simplifies trust model — one root to distribute, no intermediate CAs required |
| PKI persisted under `gateway-pki/` | Survives process restarts without regeneration; loaded at startup if all four files are present |
| Operator-provided CA supported | Allows integration with an existing enterprise PKI; auto-generation is the default for new deployments |

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- **Root CA private key** (`caKey`) is generated once and stored in a persistent, access-controlled location on the control plane's disk. It is loaded into the gateway process at startup and is never transmitted over the wire. It must never be distributed to worker LPARs.
- **Pre-shared token** is single-use. `TokenStore.Validate` consumes it on first use, preventing replay attacks.
- **CSR CN spoofing** is prevented: the gateway enforces `csr.Subject.CommonName == req.AgentName` before signing (see `gateway.Register`).
- **Agent private key** is generated locally on the worker LPAR by the agent daemon itself, stored at `/etc/ai-services/agent-tls/tls.key` with `0600` permissions, and never included in any RPC payload — only the public CSR is transmitted to the gateway.
- **`InsecureSkipVerify` fallback** is limited exclusively to the initial bootstrap `Register` call, and only when `ca.crt` is not yet present on the worker. Once registration completes, the gateway returns the server's `ca.crt` alongside the signed `tls.crt` in `RegisterResponse`; the agent writes it to `/etc/ai-services/agent-tls/ca.crt` and all subsequent connections use it for strict server verification. If `ca.crt` is provisioned on the worker before bootstrap (e.g. delivered alongside the pre-shared token during operator onboarding), the `InsecureSkipVerify` fallback is never triggered and the entire lifecycle — including the first `Register` call — operates in a fully trusted environment.
- **Certificate lifetime** is 1 year. `hasValidTLSCredentials` rejects expired certs at daemon restart, triggering re-registration with a fresh token before the agent reconnects.
- **`CommandStream` identity** is cryptographically derived from the verified TLS chain (`VerifiedChains[0][0].Subject.CommonName`), not from any application-layer claim in the message payload — preventing identity spoofing by a compromised agent.
- **10-second timeout** on the `hasValidTLSCredentials` probe prevents a stalled gateway from blocking agent startup indefinitely.
